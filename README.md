# Building security system simulator (BSSS)

The project was developed by a team of 10 people with 3 main developers and 1 software architect as demonstration project for university discipline Cross-platform programming. 

The main purpose of this project is to simulate the building security system. The building has different floors where each may or may not have detectors (such as smoke, flood, temperature, motion detectors). These detectors can activate at some point so the system has to respond to this in some way. 

The project is oriented on displaying random detectors activation with consequent system reactions on these events.


## Features

- Authentication
- Bulding floor generation with loading svg files plans
- Adding detectors to each floor
- Starting simulation
- Logging system reaction results
